# Animated Operating Systems Learning Resources

This document consolidates **high‑quality, animation‑driven resources** to deeply understand how operating systems are built and how they function internally. The focus is on **visual intuition**, not just APIs or surface‑level theory.

## 1. Big Picture: What an Operating System Is

### CrashCourse – Operating Systems
- Platform: YouTube
- Search: `CrashCourse Operating Systems`
- Why:
  - Highly animated explanations
  - Explains *why* OS exists before *how*
  - Covers kernels, abstraction, protection, and resource management

---

## 2. Kernel vs User Mode & System Calls

### Neso Academy – Operating System Playlist
- Platform: YouTube
- Search: `Neso Academy Operating System Process Management`
- Why:
  - Clean animations and diagrams
  - Excellent explanations of:
    - User mode vs kernel mode
    - System calls
    - CPU privilege levels

---

## 3. Processes, fork(), exec(), PCB (Process Control Block)

### Gate Smashers – Process Management
- Platform: YouTube
- Search: `Gate Smashers Process Control Block`
- Why:
  - Visual explanation of PCB structure
  - Clear mental model of:
    - fork() vs exec()
    - Process lifecycle
    - Context switching

---

## 4. Memory Management & Virtual Memory

### Computerphile – Virtual Memory
- Platform: YouTube
- Search: `Computerphile Virtual Memory`
- Why:
  - Uses physical metaphors
  - Explains:
    - Virtual vs physical memory
    - Paging and page tables
    - Why each process thinks it owns RAM

---

## 5. CPU Scheduling & Context Switching

### Jenny’s Lectures – Process Scheduling
- Platform: YouTube
- Search: `Process Scheduling Animation Operating System`
- Why:
  - Animated state diagrams
  - Explains:
    - Process states
    - Scheduling algorithms
    - Timer interrupts and preemption

---

## 6. How an OS Boots (Power Button to Shell)

### Linux Boot Process (Multiple Creators)
- Platform: YouTube
- Search: `Linux Boot Process Animation`
- Recommended creators:
  - Tech With Tim
  - Low Level Learning
- Why:
  - Step‑by‑step boot sequence
  - BIOS/UEFI → Bootloader → Kernel → init/systemd

---

## 7. University‑Level Deep Understanding (Optional but Powerful)

### MIT OpenCourseWare – Operating Systems
- Platform: YouTube / MIT OCW
- Search: `MIT Operating Systems Lectures`
- Why:
  - Precise, concept‑first teaching
  - Reinforces why OS design choices exist
  - Strong diagrams and reasoning

---

## Recommended Learning Order

1. CrashCourse – OS fundamentals
2. Neso Academy – Kernel & system calls
3. Gate Smashers – Process & PCB
4. Computerphile – Memory & paging
5. Jenny’s Lectures – Scheduling
6. Linux Boot Process videos
7. MIT OCW – Deep reinforcement

---

## Outcome After Completing These Resources

You will be able to clearly explain:
- How an OS controls hardware safely
- How processes are created and managed
- Why fork() and exec() behave differently
- How memory isolation works
- How scheduling and context switching occur
- How an OS starts from power‑on
